## Usage

During the development of your model, you might find the need for more robust tests.
This package provides problems and functions to that end.

The main usage of this package are the consistency checks, which runs a comparison of two or models on all API functions.

Check the [docs](https://JuliaSmoothOptimizers.github.io/NLPModelsTest.jl/dev) for the complete usage.
